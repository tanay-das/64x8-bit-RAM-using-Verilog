# 64 X 8 bit Memory Design Using Verilog

A 64 x 8 bit single port RAM using Xilinx ISE 13.4. 
Here data[7:0] represent a 8 bit data, and q[7:0] is the output.
6 address line is defined by addr[5:0]. clk is the clock signal.
we is the write enable signal.

If we is on (we=1) then data load to the register, and if the we signal is false then the data stored 
at the given address is reflected at the output.

When we signal is high then the address location (addr) stores the data , and when the we signal is low then the stored data reflected at the provided location.
