# 64 X 8 bit Memory Design Using Verilog

A 64 x 8 bit single port RAM using Xilinx ISE 13.4. 
Here data[7:0] represent a 8 bit data, and q[7:0] is the output.
6 address line is defined by addr[5:0]. clk is the clock signal.
we is the write enable signal.

If we is on (we=1) then data load to the register, and if the we signal is false then the data stored 
at the given address is reflected at the output.
